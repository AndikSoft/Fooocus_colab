    <h1>Fooocus</h1>
<p>Fooocus is an image generating software (based on Gradio).</p>

<p>Fooocus is a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourney’s designs:</p>

<p>Learned from Stable Diffusion, the software is offline, open source, and free.</p>

<p>Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.</p>

<p>Fooocus has included and automated lots of inner optimizations and quality improvements. Users can forget all those difficult technical parameters, and just enjoy the interaction between human and computer to "explore new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species" .</p>

<p>Fooocus has simplified the installation. Between pressing "download" and generating the first image, the number of needed mouse clicks is strictly limited to less than 3. Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB (Nvidia).</p>
